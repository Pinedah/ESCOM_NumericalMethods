# Numerical Methods - Class Repository

Welcome to my **Numerical Methods** class repository! This repository contains the code and projects that I will be developing during my Numerical Methods course as part of my **Data Science** studies at **IPN | ESCOM**.

## About This Course

The Numerical Methods course is focused on the development and application of computational techniques to solve mathematical problems that are typically difficult to solve analytically. Topics may include:

- Root Finding Algorithms
- Numerical Integration and Differentiation
- Interpolation and Polynomial Approximation
- Linear and Nonlinear Systems of Equations
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Numerical Solutions to Differential Equations

## Repository Structure

This repository will be organized by topic, with directories corresponding to each major subject covered in the course. Each directory will contain code examples, problem solutions, and possibly some notes or explanations about the methods used.

## Course Information

- **University**: IPN | Escuela Superior de CÃ³mputo (ESCOM)
- **Program**: Data Science
- **Course**: Numerical Methods

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse through the code, clone the repository, or use any of the examples as a reference for your own studies. Each script will include comments to explain the logic and approach used.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or contact me.
